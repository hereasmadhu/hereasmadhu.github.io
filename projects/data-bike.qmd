## Overview

As a **Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Utah**, I helped develop a low-cost "Data Bike" to assess trail conditions for users with limited mobility. The system produces actionable recommendations for maintenance, ensuring trails meet accessibility standards for all users.

## The System

The bike is instrumented with GPS, cameras, and accelerometers. My specific role involved:

* **Data Processing:** Creating workflows to fuse sensor data with video feeds.
* **Computer Vision:** Applying AI techniques to detect surface roughness, clear zones, and gradient changes.

## Outcomes
The system successfully identifies hazards and roughness, providing an automated method for ensuring trails remain accessible to users with disabilities.
