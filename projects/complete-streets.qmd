## Overview

Assessing the "walkability" of a street usually requires expensive manual audits. In this project, I developed a scalable pipeline to automate this process using street-level imagery.

## Methodology

We identified key urban design elements that influence pedestrian comfort and prepared deep learning models to process thousands of images and assign quality scores.

1.  **Data Collection:** Systematically collected street-level imagery across the network.
2.  **Model Architecture:** Utilized Computer Vision models to classify design elements (e.g., enclosure, greenery).
3.  **Scoring:** Developed a methodology to aggregate detections into a "Streetscape Design Quality" rating.

## Impact
This tool allows planners to objectively visualize street quality and prioritize interventions without the need for exhaustive manual fieldwork.
